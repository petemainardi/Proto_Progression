# Proto_Progression
Prototype 2 for VIZA 689 Adv Game Design, in which at least three different progression mechanics must be demonstrated.

The word "different" may seem superfluous until you understand that it is applied to the means of progression, not of play. The requirement is to implement mechanics that cause the player to experience progression in three separate "categories", where progression, for the purposes of this project, is loosely defined as "that which controls the player's access to game content". As such, 'solving a puzzle to unlock a door' falls under the same classification of progression as 'requiring a player to complete a platforming challenge to cross a chasm' because both mechanics control the player's access to a spatial area of the game. So it is not that three mechanics contributing to progression must be present, but that three categories of progression must be mechanically supported.
